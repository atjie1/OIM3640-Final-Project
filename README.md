# Tomato Soup: Show Picker App

Tomato Soup, a Kivy application, is for a user who is in need of a popular TV-series to watch from Netflix, specificaly, a TV series that is rated high enough by Rotten Tomatoes's tomatometer and audience score. 

## Big Idea / Goal
My original project idea included creating a mobile app to replicate the mobile app business plan wireframe that I create in the Mobile App Course with Professor Gillan-Huang. However, during my process of exploring Django, I came across the problem of not knowing what movie I wanted to watch for movie night. This is a serious issue that I have all the time, especially with TV-shows. I am a serial binge-watcher... 

I did some research and there are already apps that exist that will generate movie titles that are highly rated and trending, but there weren't any applications for TV-show generators. Therefore, I set myself on creating a TV-show generator app that would be based off of one of my favorite websites: Rotten Tomatoes. I wanted to practice some of the skills that I had already learned and gained: webscraping, and then I wanted to explore the Kivy application, an open source support for cross-application production and GUI in Python.

## Attribution

In the code, there are comments for sources that I found integral help from that are given credit which include videos and stackoverflow posts for debugging and templating. Additionally, ChatGPT was integral to the success and implementation of this project. If there is no source listed, then users can assume ChatGPT was used to support implementation.
