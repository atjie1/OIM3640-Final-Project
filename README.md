# OIM3640-Final-Project
Abby Tjie

1. **The Big Idea**
   
   I will be exploring creating an application that can connect international students with their family members across differing time zones. The application will allow users to join into groups with their family members. Using the location of each individual member of the family as inputs, the application will run and create a notification schedule. The notification schedule uses the daytime hours of each family member's time zone to find the shared daytime hours between the family. The notification will prompt the user to take a picture that is stored in a shared folder. This application would enable family members who are apart for extended periods to collect memories across distances.

2. **Learning Objectives**
   By creating this product, I will be fulfilling the idea that was born in the Mobile App course with Professor Gillan-Huang. In this course, my team named "OneZone" created a business plan for this mobile app idea and pitched it using a wireframe created by Balsamic. We won the pitch competition judged by a Babson MBA alumnae director of a venture capital firm. In this project, I will learn the technical side of developing a mobile app prototype through a web application, but I will also be able to code the basics to my team's business idea. 
   
3. **Implementation Plan**
   Google's Time Zone API
   Kivy Python library

4. **Project Schedule**
5. **Collaboration Plan**
   I have chosen to forgo collaborating with teammates and will be working alone on this project to test my individual capabilities. While working alone avoids possible team conflicts, management and scheduling is still important for a self-managed project. Firstly, I will define the acceptance critera for the final project. Then I will create a spreadsheet of feature requests, prioritize the most important ones, and define the function tasks that will be necessary to building these features. Then I will timebox sessions for the next upcoming weeks in order to meet the deadline for the product. Using structure for my project will enable me to develop a working, sleek finished deliverable.

6. **Risks and Limitations**
   The greatest threat to the project is not being able to fully complete the complex product. This project will require using coding concepts that are beyond this course. I must consider if I have the sufficient time to explore and learn these concepts within the deadline. I will most likely be limited to a web page, but I want to create a mobile application if possible.

7. **Additional Course Conent**
   The python topics that we have learned in this course that will be relevant and beneficial to my project is calling APIs and libraries, creating forms on web applications through Flask, and 
   Kivy library in python to create graphical user interface components
