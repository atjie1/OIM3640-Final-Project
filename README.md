# OIM3640-Final-Project
Abby Tjie

1. **The Big Idea**
   Using Google's Time Zone API, I will be exploring how to create an application that can connect international students with their family members across differing time zones. The MVP will take the users' timezones, identify the daytime hours within each timezone and output a schedule with connection time blocks. Additional features include notifying that the one zone has begun and when it has ended or being able to timeblock directly into your google calendar. 
2. **Learning Objectives**
   
3. **Implementation Plan**
   Google's Time Zone API

4. **Project Schedule**
5. **Collaboration Plan**
   I have chosen to forgo collaborating with teammates and working alone on this project to test my individual capabilities. While working alone avoids collaborative management mistaks and conflicts, management and scheduling is still very important for a self-managed project. I intend to first define the acceptance critera for the project. Then I will create a spreadsheet of feature requests, prioritize the most important ones, and define the engineering tasks that will be necessary to building these features. Then I will timebox each session for the next upcoming weeks in order to meet the deadline for the product. Using structure for my project will enable me to develop a working, sleek finished deliverable.
6. **Risks and Limitations**
